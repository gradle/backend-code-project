# Gradle Enterprise Backend Code Project

Congratulations on advancing to the code project for a Backend Engineer position on the Gradle Enterprise team!

This project aims to allow you to demonstrate your expertise and skills using an industry-standard language such as `Java` or `Kotlin`, 
a modern microservice libray that embraces aysnchronous programming as provided by `Armeria`, one or more testing frameworks of your choice, 
and the widely-adopted build tool `Gradle`.

## Installation instructions

You are already provided with a scaffold, including a Gradle build to assemble and run the server and a client.

### Server

From the root of the checked out project, start the minimal server and navigate to [http://localhost:5555/](http://localhost:5555/):

`./gradlew :server:start`

### Client

From the root of the checked out project, run the provided client that invokes the server in various configurations and observe the console output:

`./gradlew :client:run`

## Implementation instructions

Follow the detailed instructions provided to you via email.
