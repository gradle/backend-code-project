# Gradle Enterprise Backend Code Project

Congratulations on advancing to the code project for a Backend Engineer position on the Gradle Enterprise team!

This project aims to allow you to demonstrate your expertise and skills using an industry-standard language such as `Java` or `Kotlin`, a modern microservice library that embraces asynchronous programming as provided by `Armeria`, one or more testing frameworks of your choice, and the widely-adopted build tool `Gradle`.

## Installation instructions

You are already provided with a scaffold, including a Gradle build to assemble and run a HTTP server.

From the root of this project, start the minimal server and navigate to [http://localhost:5555/](http://localhost:5555/):

`./gradlew :server:start`

## Implementation instructions

Follow the detailed instructions in the PDF that have been provided to you via email.

## Validation instructions

Ensure the server is assembled and the automated test suites executed when running the following command:

`./gradlew :server:build`

## Evaluation criteria

The following criteria will play into the evaluation of your submission:

- Overall architecture and solution structure
- Code organization, readability, and easiness to follow
- Data mapping and transformation
- Error and edge case handling
- Test coverage

## Reasoning

### Choices and considered alternatives

_Please include the reasoning about the choices you made and the alternatives you considered._

### Future improvements (if you had more time)

_Optional. For you to fill._

## Checklist

- [ ] Instructions have been followed closely
- [ ] All given advice has been read carefully and applied
- [ ] Evaluation criteria have been considered
- [ ] Implementation can be validated for correctness using the Gradle command listed above
- [ ] Decisions are described in the README file
- [ ] Zip-file is created without any build artifacts in it and uploaded to Gradle
